# FlutterPokedex
Flutter-based pokedex following iampawan's youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeXJqZCiwTQ&t=995s).

This project experiments with:
  -Flutter StateFull and StateLess widgets
  -Flutter JSON parsing
  -Flutter API calls
 
My extensions to the original project include:
  -Implementing widget classes that can be reused beyond just this project:
    1) StatefulScaffold(String title, StatefulWidget body)
